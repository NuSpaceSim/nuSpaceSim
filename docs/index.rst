Welcome to nuSpaceSim
===================

Î½SpaceSim

This is the beta release of the nuSpaceSim simulator tool!

This application includes the main scheduler code which calculates the tau
neutrino acceptance for the Optical Cherenkov technique. The configuration
settings for which are controlled by an input XML configuration file. Generating
a new file with input parameters is also supported.

Tau propagation is interpolated using included data tables from Reno et at.
2019.
